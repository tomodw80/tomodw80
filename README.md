- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomodw80
- 👀 I’m Irish, but currently live in London.  I'm interested in cloud engineering and am currently working towards a 
      career-move in the cloud sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the linux command line, terraform, and Git and am AWS certified for CCP and going for SAA
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really.  It'd be awesome to team up with someone in the same/similar 
      situtaion and work on some things together
- 📫 How to reach me: most of the socials I'm subscribed to have the same tag - tomodw 
- 😄 Pronouns: he /him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that wombats have cube-shaped poop? It’s true! Their poop comes out in little cubes, and 
     scientists believe it's to keep it from rolling away, helping them mark their territory more effectively.
